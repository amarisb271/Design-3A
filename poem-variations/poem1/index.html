        <h1>You are doing brave things</h1>
<p>“I cannot tell you what lies ahead, <br>
    <br> 
    but I can tell you: you will grow. <br>
    <br> <br>
    Your ability to keep going each day <br>
    
    is a sign of courage on its own.  <br>
    
    I know that peace feels far away  <br>
    
    as you try to make sense of all the change,  <br>
    
    and I just hope you can remember this:  <br>
    
    You do not have to make sense of it all <br>
    
    in order to be worthy of peace. <br>
    
    To be the one who keeps breathing <br>
    
    in the unknown is a brave and miraculous thing. <br>
    
    Learning to exhale is no small feat. <br>
    <br> <br>

    You are doing brave things. <br>
    
    Yes, you are doing brave things <br>
    
    even though it doesn’t always feel that way.”  <br>
