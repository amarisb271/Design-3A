<h1>Poem</h1>
<p>“I cannot tell you what lies ahead,
    
    but I can tell you: you will grow.
    
    Your ability to keep going each day
    
    is a sign of courage on its own.
    
    I know that peace feels far away
    
    as you try to make sense of all the change,
    
    and I just hope you can remember this:
    
    You do not have to make sense of it all
    
    in order to be worthy of peace.
    
    To be the one who keeps breathing
    
    in the unknown is a brave and miraculous thing.
    
    Learning to exhale is no small feat.
    
    You are doing brave things.
    
    Yes, you are doing brave things
    
    even though it doesn’t always feel that way.”
