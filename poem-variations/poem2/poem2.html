        <h1>Poem</h1>
<p>“I do not know where tomorrow 

    will lead,
    
    but I know I am free
    
    to give my all
    
    with audacious hope
    
    for what could be.
    
    And maybe I do not
    
    have to know
    
    how it all works out
    
    in the end
    
    to let this time in my life be
    
    something worth remembering.
    
    The fear does not
    
    have to go away
    
    before I choose
    
    to practice courage
    
    with what I create.
    
    And whenever I
    
    start to feel that I am not
    
    good enough,
    
    I will work to remember:
    
    it still matters
    
    to show up with love.
    
    I am not the only one 
    
    who feels like this
    
    and when I choose to practice courage out in the open
    
    it makes a difference.”
